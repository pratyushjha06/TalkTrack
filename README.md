## So,What TalkTrack do ?
### TalkTrack -
is your smart meeting assistant. It listens to your meetings, writes down everything that’s said, and even summarizes the important points—so you don’t have to!

Imagine you're in a long meeting, and instead of scrambling to take notes, you can just focus on the discussion. TalkTrack automatically records the conversation, converts speech into text (transcription), and picks out key points for you. This way, you won’t miss anything important, and you can always go back and find exactly what was discussed.

It’s like having a personal secretary for every meeting! Whether you're working remotely, attending an online class, or brainstorming with your team, TalkTrack helps you stay organized, save time, and keep track of everything without the hassle of note-taking.
